Akibai Explorer Learning Brain
==============================

1. Delete the frontend and recreate it from scratch. Verify its integration with the backend and stop and launch the app.
   - Pathway: Deleted frontend directory, recreated with Vite/React, patched custom UI, generated Dockerfile, rebuilt and relaunched containers.
   - Result: Frontend and backend integrated, containers running.

2. Replace the default Vite web page with the app frontend UI home page.
   - Pathway: Patched src/App.jsx with custom UI, applied Google Play branding.
   - Result: Custom home page displayed.

3. Generate a new Dockerfile for the akibai frontend and relaunch the app.
   - Pathway: Created Dockerfile, rebuilt frontend container.
   - Result: Frontend container built and running.

4. Stop and restart the app.
   - Pathway: Used docker compose down/up and restart commands.
   - Result: App containers restarted successfully.

5. Repair the wiring between the backend and the frontend UI and launch the app.
   - Pathway: Fixed Vite proxy config, verified API connectivity.
   - Result: Frontend fetches backend data.

6. Remove any references to rolldown-vite in your frontend project. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json in frontend/akibai-explorer-frontend. Reinstall dependencies with npm install. Rebuild and relaunch the app.
   - Pathway: Removed rolldown-vite, cleaned node_modules/package-lock.json, reinstalled, rebuilt containers.
   - Result: Frontend container healthy, app launches.

7. Update the proxy target to use the Docker Compose backend service name.
   - Pathway: Changed Vite proxy to 'http://backend:3001', restarted frontend.
   - Result: API requests proxied correctly.

8. Create an elegant table containing the results. Each record row will display: [unique incremental id, repo number, repo url (clickable), repo name, repo description (if available)]. Create a text prompt widget for the user to enter criteria to be searched in the github explorer engine followed by an elegant glossy submit button. Use the brand identity information in the file dox/brand-ui-frontend-google.txt to refactor the UI frontend.
   - Pathway: Refactored src/App.jsx, added table, search widget, glossy button, Google Play branding.
   - Result: UI displays elegant table and search widget.

9. Refactor the github explorer engine so that after each repo search the repo is saved and seeds the database and in the first row of the table.
   - Pathway: Modified frontend to POST search, backend saves/seeds, result shown in first row.
   - Result: Searched repo appears at top of table.

10. Fix [plugin:vite:react-babel] /app/src/App.jsx: Unexpected token error.
    - Pathway: Fixed JSX syntax in form element.
    - Result: App compiles and runs without syntax errors.

11. Fix Error 404: Cannot POST /api/github/search using the self-healing script and ensure that the result dynamically becomes the first row of the table.
    - Pathway: Added /search route to backend, rebuilt, restarted containers.
    - Result: /api/github/search available, frontend POST works.

12. Save the app's current savepoint, run the save-stage-commit-push workflow, and create zip/tar.gz backup copies.
    - Pathway: Will be executed below.

All results above were successful and did not require further bug correction after the final fix.

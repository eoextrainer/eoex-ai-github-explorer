Akibai Explorer Learning Brain
==============================

1. Delete the frontend and recreate it from scratch. Verify its integration with the backend and stop and launch the app.
   - Pathway: Deleted frontend directory, recreated with Vite/React, patched custom UI, generated Dockerfile, rebuilt and relaunched containers.
   - Result: Frontend and backend integrated, containers running.

2. Replace the default Vite web page with the app frontend UI home page.
   - Pathway: Patched src/App.jsx with custom UI, applied Google Play branding.
   - Result: Custom home page displayed.

3. Generate a new Dockerfile for the akibai frontend and relaunch the app.
   - Pathway: Created Dockerfile, rebuilt frontend container.
   - Result: Frontend container built and running.

Akibai Learning Brain
====================

This file documents every user instruction and every successful result (no error, bug, or failure) for the Akibai Explorer project, including the algorithmic pathway used for each.

---

1. Delete the frontend and recreate it from scratch. Verify its integration with the backend and stop and launch the app.
   - Deleted frontend directory, recreated with Vite/React, reconnected to backend, and relaunched containers.
   - Pathway: rm -rf, npm create vite@latest, Dockerfile regeneration, docker compose up --build -d.

2. Replace the default Vite web page with the app frontend UI home page.
   - Patched src/App.jsx to use custom UI, fetch backend data, and display results.
   - Pathway: Patch App.jsx, verify fetch to /api/github/results, reload frontend.

3. Generate a new Dockerfile for the akibai frontend and relaunch the app.
   - Created Dockerfile for Vite/React, rebuilt and relaunched containers.
   - Pathway: Dockerfile creation, docker compose up --build -d.

4. Stop and restart the app.
   - Used docker compose down && up --build -d and docker compose restart.
   - Pathway: Docker Compose commands.

5. Repair the wiring between the backend and the frontend UI and launch the app.
   - Ensured Vite proxy config, fetch logic, and backend API health.
   - Pathway: vite.config.js proxy, App.jsx fetch, backend API test.

6. Remove rolldown-vite references, clean node_modules and package-lock.json, reinstall dependencies, rebuild and relaunch.
   - Removed all rolldown-vite, reinstalled with correct Vite, rebuilt and relaunched.
   - Pathway: grep/sed, rm -rf, npm install, docker compose up --build -d.

7. Fix frontend/backend integration so /api/github/results returns valid JSON.
   - Updated Vite proxy to use backend service name, confirmed JSON response.
   - Pathway: vite.config.js proxy to http://backend:3001, docker compose restart.

8. Create elegant table UI, search prompt, glossy button, and Google Play branding.
   - Refactored App.jsx for table, search, and branding using brandkit-ui-frontend-google.txt.
   - Pathway: Patch App.jsx, CSS variables, UI/UX enhancements.

9. Refactor search to POST to backend, save/seed repo, and show as first row.
   - Modified App.jsx to POST to /api/github/search, insert result at top.
   - Pathway: App.jsx form onSubmit, backend batchGithubSearch, table update.

10. Add /api/github/search route to backend.
    - Patched github.routes.ts, rebuilt backend, restarted container.
    - Pathway: Add route, tsc build, docker compose restart.

11. Fix JSX syntax error in App.jsx form.
    - Closed onSubmit function before style prop.
    - Pathway: Patch App.jsx, docker compose restart.

12. Run self-healing script to fix backend routing.
    - Ensured /api/github/search is available and working.
    - Pathway: bash dox/self-healing.sh, verify routes, rebuild/restart backend.

13. Savepoint: App works as designed, all features validated.
    - Pathway: All containers healthy, UI/UX validated, search and seeding work, no errors.

---

Algorithmic Pathway Summary:
- For each instruction, the system:
  1. Validated the current state (file, config, or container).
  2. Applied the required patch or command.
  3. Rebuilt/restarted affected services.
  4. Verified the result (API, UI, or logs).
  5. If no error, marked as successful and moved to next step.
